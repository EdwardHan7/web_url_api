URL Shortener Service
A simple Flask-based service that provides URL shortening functionality.

Features
URL Shortening: Takes a long URL and returns a shortened version.
Validation: Checks for valid URL format before shortening.
Encryption: Utilizes cryptography for URL shortening, ensuring uniqueness and security.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pip
Installation
Clone this repository:

git clone [repo-link]

Navigate to the project directory:

cd path/to/project

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the service:

python app/main.py
API Endpoints
Shorten URL
Endpoint: /shorten_url
Method: POST
Data: {"long_url": "your-long-url-here"}
Returns: Shortened URL or an error message in case of invalid input.
Testing
Tests are written using Python's unittest framework. To run the tests, execute:

python -m unittest path/to/test_file.py
CI/CD Pipeline Configuration and Deployment Plans
We utilize a simple CI/CD pipeline:

Continuous Integration (CI):
Automatically run unit and integration tests upon code pushes to ensure code quality and functional correctness.

Continuous Deployment (CD):
Upon successful CI, the code is deployed to a staging environment. After approval, it's promoted to production.

Identified Gaps & Future Improvements
URL Expiry: Currently, the shortened URLs do not have an expiry date. In a real production system, we might want to implement URL expiration to free up shortened URLs after some time.

Analytics: We could also implement analytics to monitor the number of clicks a shortened URL receives.

Redirection: As of now, the shortened URLs are not operable. In a production scenario, we'd have a system in place to redirect these URLs to their original counterparts.

Database Storage: The current solution doesn't involve storing the mappings of shortened URLs to their original URLs in a database. This would be necessary for a production-ready system.
